# Email-phishing-detection-in-gmail-account-using-nlp
This project is about to detect wheather the email is phishing or not from the gmail account

1.Why I Built This

> "I was curious about how spam filters work and wanted to build my own. This project combines three things I love: Python, security, and AI."


> "The model is trained on **2,934** emails from Book1.csv:
> - **1,910** legitimate emails
> - **1,024** phishing emails"

**Where did you get the data?**
- "Downloaded from Kaggle's phishing email dataset"
- "Collected from personal emails (anonymized)"
- "Combined multiple public datasets"
- "Created from course materials"


**Technical Skills:**
> "This was my first time:
> - Working with the Gmail API and OAuth authentication
> - Using TF-IDF for text classification
> - Deploying a trained model in a real application
> - Handling imbalanced datasets in ML"

**Challenges:**
> "The hardest parts were:
> - Understanding Gmail API permissions and scopes
> - Dealing with HTML-formatted emails that broke my text processing
> - Finding the right balance - too sensitive means legitimate emails go to spam, too lenient means phishing gets through
> - Debugging authentication issues with Google OAuth"
